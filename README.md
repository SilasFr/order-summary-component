## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My learning curve in this project was more towards how easy a nice desing can be achived, even using the same color in different tones. I also liked how the negative space around the elements make a difference.

In terms of HTML and CSS this project is quite simple, and does not require any more knowledge than the privious one.

### Continued development

Further on I want to explore the use of negative space in my creative projects and see how it causes an impact in the user.
